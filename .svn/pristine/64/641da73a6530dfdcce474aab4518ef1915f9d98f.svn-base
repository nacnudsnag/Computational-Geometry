Includes:
	-geom.cpp: file for geometric functions used to compute visibility graphy
	-geom.h
	-motion.cpp: main file 
	-mouse1.cpp
	-mouse2.cpp
	
Instructions:

Keys: 			Use:
B			click twice to define opposite corners of robot
			third click will place the destination point
Z 			Innitiates obstacle drawing
C			Draw a new polygon obstacle
V			Compute the free space for A*
I			Run A*
U			Visualize path computed by A* 
O			Animate robot moving along path (hold down)
R			Run rrt on the obstacle course 

 


Known Issues:

make sure implemenation for A* lets you place the robot again in the same obstacle course 
for faster run times since finding free space takes forever 

do we need to calculate free space before rrt?? No 
we should make sure case r can run after doing A* on the same course 
make A* less than like 4 screens of code 
rename stuff like roboto to make it make more sense
