Read_Me for art gallery project

This implementation allows for two guards to be placed in a simple polygon drawn by the user.  The guards can be moved with the 
wsad and ikjl keys.  

Keys:
z - initialize drawing the polygon
c - start computing the visible polygon from the placed guards
g - place guard 1
	w - move guard 1 + y
	s - move guard 1 - y
	d - move guard 1 + x
	a - move guard 1 -x
h - place guard 2
	i - move guard 2 + y
	k - move guard 2 - y
	l - move guard 2 + x
	j - move guard 2 - x

e - increase speed
r - decrease speed 


Known Issues:
There are some degenerate cases taht cause problems for a few of the functions.  
	isInside sometimes determines that the guard is outside the polygon 
	In some cases, the projected points do not work properly.
